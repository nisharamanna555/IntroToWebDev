Coming into my final, I had a website which was almost fully complete. I needed to build out the projects and contact me section. However, I was pretty unhappy with the look of the site so I decided to do a total overhaul. It took me some time to figure out how exactly I wanted it to look, but once I identified an aesthetic, I was able to move forward.
One place I really struggled was the resume section. I had felt in my last website that it was just so long that it wasn't readable. However, I wasn't sure how to combat this. When looking for inspiration, I came across this portfolio:

For the work section, it featured a table which revealed more information when you hovered over a certain section. I really liked this because then the user wasn't bombarded by information as soon as they looked at the resume. I decided to implement this idea on my website. I used this intro to HTML tables as a guide:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
I then did additionaly research to get the JavaScript for the hovering over the table to work.

Another struggle was getting the tech icons to work. I used this portfolio as inspiration/source code:

I also used this Staack Overflow for help:

Issues:
    Making the site responsive
        The website looked super messy and took many many media queries to get fully responsive.
    Figuring out the layout for my Resume section
        Because of the structure of my Resume section there was a huge blank space to the left of my table when you weren't hovering over the table. Trying to create a design I liked and figure out how to get it to show up only when not hovering over the table was super difficult. I used Canva to get design inspiration.

What I learned:
    More JavaScript (.mouseout vs .mouseover, animation to move the magazine letters, etc.)
    How to work with HTML tables
    Getting text to appear when I hovered

Future:
    I'm not happy with how my Resume section resizes- the popup goes over the table. However, I didn't think making the popup go ontop of the table would look nice either because you may not be able to see it based on where on the site you are. I think instead of absolutely positioning the popup I'll have to place it relative to the row being hovered over.
    My media queries also still aren't 100% perfect, there's more I could adjust.
