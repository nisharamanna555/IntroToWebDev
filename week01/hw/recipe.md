1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, according to the instructions on box.
2. While the pasta is cooking, cut up sun dried tomatoes to your preference. Cut mozzarella balls in to quarters.

4. Add pesto to the pasta. Add reserved pasta water until the sauce is loose enough for your liking.
5. Add in chopped sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella balls.
